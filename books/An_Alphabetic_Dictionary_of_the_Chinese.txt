PREFACE .
€ 03

As two names appear on the title-page of this dictionary , it
is proper to indicate our respective shares in its preparation; and
the more so , as it is due to the Rev. Mr. Baldwin to state that the

larger portion of the labor of authorship has been freely performed
by him , and that to his correct scholarship, extensive knowledge of
the Foochow dialect, and indomitable perseverance, the dictionary is

mainly indebted for the degree of thoroughness and accuracy it may
possess. The manuscript for that portion of the dictionary compris

ed in pp. 1–631 was originally prepared by myself, but it was sub
sequently very carefully revised and improved by Mr. Baldwin , and

a considerable portion of it ( pp. 403—631) was entirely re -written by

him . The portion comprised in pp. 632—1014 , together with the In
troduction to the dictionary, was prepared by Mr. Baldwin, and, as
it was impracticable for me to revise his manuscript, it was printed
just as it came from his hands. The general plan of the work and a
responsibility for the whole are mine.
The design and scope of the dictionary are so fully set forth

in the Introduction , given on subsequent pages, that it is unneces
sary to make any extended remarks on the subject in this place.
The aim has been to present a work that shall at once illustrate
the Foochow dialect, and prove a valuable help to all students of
the Chinese language. The definitions of the characters, and a
large number of the phrases given under them , will apply equally
well to any dialect through which the student seeks to acquire a
knowledge of the general written language of China. Everything in

iv

PREFACE .

the work that is peculiar to the Foochow dialect has been carefully
marked , so that the student cannot be misled on this point. The
large number of Romanized words appearing in the dictionary, and

for which the written language furnishes no characters, is an interest
ing feature of this dialect, and indicates that modern Chinese thought

is outgrowing the stereotyped forms of this ancient language. The
same feature appears in other dialects.

It is difficult to assign exact geographical limits to the Foo
chow dialect, or to estimate with precision the amount of the popula
tion by whom it is spoken. In Foochow city, the capital of the

Fookien province, and throughout the Foochow and Fooning pre
fectures, it is , with considerable variations, the vernacular of the
people. Beyond these limits, it is spoken only by the Foochow
merchants, artisans, &c. &c. who reside in most of the important cities
of Fookien. Regarding Foochow city as the center of the dialect, we
may say that it extends, eastward to the sea , a distance of about
thirty miles; northward , to the Chehkiang province, two hundred
miles; westward, to. the Yenping prefecture, one hundred miles ;
and southward, to the Hinghwa prefecture, seventy miles. It is
probable the dialect is spoken by five millions of people . The only

native work on the dialect is a small Tonic dictionary, named the
Paik Ing ( Eight Sounds), and containing about 10,000 characters,
which are distributed, according to their tones, under what are called
the Initials and Finals of the dialect.

The work is noticed more

at length in the Introduction to this dictionary.
In the preparation of this dictionary, the results of the labors

of Drs. Morrison , Medhurst, and Williams, in Anglo -Chinese lexicog
raphy, have been freely availed of, and this general acknowledge
ment of indebtedness is gratefully made. Sincere thanks are tendered
to those members of the Missionary community in Foochow who have,
in many ways, rendered valuable assistance - especially to the Rev.
S. L. Baldwin , and Rev. L. N. Wheeler, whose opportune help made
it possible to publish the work in Foochow , and under whose consec
utive superintendence five hundred pages of it were printed. A large
portion of the Mandarin sounds, which appear under the leading
characters in the dictionary, were kindly furnished by Walter T. Lay

PREFACE .

Esqr. of the Imperial Maritime Customs: Mr. Lay, however, is not
responsible for any typographic errors in this department, as it was
impossible for him to correct the proof-sheets while the work was
passing through the press.
A brief list of Additions is placed at the end of the dictionary
proper, and in it are given some additional uses of characters, and a

few Romanized words and phrases which do not appear in the body
of the work . A table of Corrections is given at the close of the volume,
in which the more important errors occurring in the dictionary have
been noted : the errors not corrected in the table are thought to be of

an unimportant character, and their appropriate correction is readily
suggested by the connection in which they occur. In the Index of
Characters, where brackets have been used , it will be noticed that fre
quently the same character is repeated once or twice.

In these

instances the character has different tones which affect its meaning.
The figures indicate where each forio is found .
The printing of the dictionary, in view of the limited and im
perfect appliances at command, has been a difficult and tedious task :

the type-setting and press-work have been performed by Chinese
hands; and , during the printing of the larger portion of the work ,

the supervision of the press and the drudgery of correcting the first
" proofs”, have unavoidably devolved on myself. A consideration of
these circumstances will, perhaps, mitigate the severity of criticism ,
with regard to the defects and errors thatmay be detected in the work .

The expenses of publication have been defrayed by the Mission Press
connected with the Foochow Mission of the Methodist Episcopal
Church, U. S. A.; and it is hoped that the proceeds arising from the
sale of the book may reimburse the Office for the the heavy outlay .
The lexicographic elucidation of, at least , the more prominent

dialects of China may, perhaps, be regarded as a pressing demand
of the times. A knowledge of the proverbs, peculiar idioms , and
common speech of a people so numerous as the Chinese will throw
important light on questions connected with the general laws of

language; and is absolutely necessary to all who seek to influence

Chinese mind, or form a correct estimate of Chinese character.
The materials for the following dictionary have gradually accumulat.

ed in our hands, from various sources, during twenty years of ordinary

study and labor as missionaries . It has been our cherished hope that
ultimately they might assume a permanent form , so as to be of service

to others who may follow us in the study and use of the Chinese
language; and it is with much satisfaction that we are now permitted ,
in the providence of God , to realize that hope : at the same time
we recognize the entire truthfulness of Dr. Johnson's remark, that

while “ every other author may aspire to praise, the lexicographer can
only hope to escape reproach ".

The work is now offered to the public, with the earnest desire
that it may be useful to students of the Chinese language; that it

may tend to facilitate friendly intercourse between Western nations
and China ; and , above all, that it may promote the cause of Christian
Missions among the Chinese.

INTRODUCTION.
:0:

The design of this Dictionary is to assist the student in the

acquisition both of the classic or written, and the vernacular or spok
en, forms of the Foochow dialect. The former in style, idiom , and usage
often differs widely from the latter. In orthography however all the
tables of initials, finals, and words are precisely the same in both forms;

and many single words and phrases that are strictly classic or com
mon book -phrases are also used in the spoken language. A consider
able part of such phrases are however confined to the literary class
of the people. This has led some to style the more refined terms
teachers' or scholars' patois. The common use of some phrases in
the reading and colloquial styles appears in the plan of the work. It

is farther evident that a fair proportion of the phrases in Chinese
character at the foot of the page, as also the definitions of the lead
ing classic or lexicographic characters are the common property of
the mandarin and local dialects of the empire. It is hoped therefore
that this volume will be of general use to students of the Chinese
language.

The work contains 928 different syllabic divisions or sections, as
written in Roman letters and numbered in the text. This of course
does not include all the distinctions arising from difference in tone.

The number ofleading classic and colloquial characters, including the
abbreviated and duplicate or alternate forms, and those repeated un
der different sounds is 9390. The number of paragraphs with one

or more leading characters is 8311, and the number introduced

by Romanized colloquial words, without Chinese characters to re
present them , is 1242, nuaking the whole number of paragraphs in the
Chinese and English text 9553. Besides these two classes, some
characters are found in the phrases at the foot of the page, which

do not appear in the main text as leading characters. In such
cases the meaning of the character appears in the definition of the

phrase where its Romanized equivalent occurs, and this is often the
only, or the most important, meaning it ever has in the language.
There are also occasional instances of unimportant colloqnial words
or particles, in combination with other words in the Romanizeď

phrases, which do not appear independently as leading words,
The arrangement of the work is alphabetic , excepting that the
aspirate and composite initials are treated as single and independent
letters. The order then is a, ch, ch', e, h, i, k, kó, l, m, n , ng, o , p , p ',
$, 1, t', U, w, y . The Chinese characters are arranged in the order of
the tones, when the Romanized spelling for their sounds is the same.
The mandarin sounds are in general according to Wade's system ,

and are placed under the characters. The general definitions are on
the authority of Kanghi's Imperial Dictionary and native authors,
as interpreted by teachers and lexicographers. The colloquial or

unauthorized meanings are always clearly distinguished. Sometimes
an additional reading of a leading character is given before the
general definitions, when its detinitions are the same in the differ

ent readings. When they are different, both the reading and defini
tions are usually given at the close of the paragraph or in the proper
alphabetic place in the book .

In the latter case reference is made to

the different sound at the end of the general definitions.
The standard authority among native scholars for the readings
of characters, as well as for their meanings, is Kanghi's Dictionary.
The Puik Ing, a native tonic dictionary, is not classic authority,
though prized as a convenient Manual of the Rudiments of this dialect
• and as furnishing brief definitions of characters. L'sage however

often disregards the readings of both these dictionaries.

And in the

present work such sage is frequently followed in assigning a charac

ier its Romanized alphabetic place, while the reading discarded by
native usage is noted in the frase “ Read .... in the dictionaries ” im

mediately following the character. The readings of the Paik Ing are
mostly used to introduce colloquial words and phrases. But even in

this respect there is no strict rule followed by native teachers. They
use much liberty, often choosing, either for its sound or its sense,
some classic character, simpler than the one found in the Puik Ing.
The phrases are distinguished into three classes: ( 1 ) those
following the general definitions are classic or book phrases; (2 ) those
under com ., are common to the written and spoken languages, and
include many refined terms and some epistolary phrases ; (3 ) those
under coll., are such as, by reason of idiom, meaning, or colloquial

characters used wholly or partly to represent them , may be more
properly classed as colloquial phrases. The number of phrases in this
dictionary is estimated at 30,000 to 35,000, of which gor i are com

prised in the last two classes above mentioned, and are consequently

used with more or less frequency in the ordinary business of life.
A slight acquaintance with the language will convince the
student of the impossiblity of making a thorough and perfect distinc

tion of the phrases into such classes. The literary tastes, knowledge,
mental habits, and modes of speaking of different native teachers, as
also the conceptions of the same teacher at different times, all tend to
make the limits of the three classes somewhat variable, as found by
actual experience in our work . Still there is ground for the distinc
tion , and we hope that it will be useful in showing generally what
phrases are spoken and what are not.
It should also be remarked in reference to the definitions of many

of the colloquial phrases that there is no very fixed standard by which
to test them . Usage varies to some extent in different places , while

teachers and others often fail to agree in their explanations. This is
peculiarly the case in reference to proverbial phrases. Some are uni
versally known and used . Others are local, and others still are different

ly explained and applied in different localities.

The native standard of pronunciation fs a work called me til
À J Chek Ling Prik Ing Hak Teng or more simply thePaik
Ing, or Eight Tone Book. As seen from the full title it is a compila
tion of the works of two authors, Ch'ek and Ling. The page is divid
ed by a horizontal line . The lower section is by Ling, and the char
acters are arranged by a system of 20 initials and 35 finals. As a

dictionary, it is somewhat more comprehensive than the upper part,
but it is not used as a standard of pronunciation . The upper section

is ascribed originally to Ch'ek (a military chieftain of the Ming dynas

ty, known familiarly as ng

Ch'ek ch‘ang chiong ), and is the

only standard of pronunciation for the Foochow dialect.

It is a

dictionary in which all the characters are systematically arranged
according to their sounds. Each simple word has three elements,
an nitial sound, a final sound, and a tone. The initials are termed
che tau, word -heads.

The finals are termed che mó, word

mothers, or fundamental generic sounds. To represent the former,
15 characters, having the 15 different initial sounds, are used . To
represent the latter, 33 characters are in like manner employed .
The original number was 36, but three of these became obsolete on
3ccount of identity in sound with other three in the list . This sya

INTRODUCTION .

tem of initials, finals, and tones constitutes the alphabet of the lan
guage. All the characters of the Paik Ing are arranged under the
33 finals, as the leading element or symbol, with the subdivision into
15 classes under cach final according to the initial sounds of the char
acters, and the farther subdivision into 7 classes under each initial

according to their tones. In practice, however, it will be found that
for a considerable number of possible combinations of the Initials
and Finals with their Tonic inflections, there are neither written

characters nor colloquial words in this dialect. The above arrangement
of characters with the r definitions constitutes Chinese Alphabetic
Dictionary.
By referring to the Tables below , the student will observe that
an initial sound is a single consonant or two consonants combined ,

and that no vowel is ever used as an initial. (Words under the eng
initial, however, inay be regarded as beginning with the vowel of the
final sound or with w or y). It is also seen that a final sound con

sists of a vowel or vowels, sometimes preceded by w or y, and some
times followed by h , k, ur ng.
Toxes .

The tonic marks belong properly to the Romanized orthogra
phy of the language, as the tone is always an essential part of the
word . In theory and as commonly spoken of, there are eight tones

in this dialect, but practically only seven , as the second and sixth are
identical , and the characters and spoken words having this peculiari
ty of sound are invariably referred to the second tone. The tonic
marks are the same as those used in Williams' Tonic Dictionary.
They consist of semicircles, and semicircles combined with horizontal
strokes .

Their position at the corners of characters and words in

dicates the tone, as seen in the following diagram :

DESCRIPTION OF THE TONES .

entering or abrupt tone.
The names given to the tones alove

are merely translations of the Chinese terms and furnish a very imper

fect idea of their nature. The following very concise, lucid, and
scientific description, with diagrams of the tones , is from the pen of
Rev. Charles Hartwell of the American Board Mission .

“The tones have five elements, which are pitch, quality of voice, in
flection , stress, and time.
The first tone has the pitch of a third, is the head tone in

quality of voice, and is without inflection , without stress, and long in
time.

The second tone is a minor third below the first, and

has the pitch of sharp one. It is near the orotund in quality of

voice, is without inflection , has the thorough stress, and is long in
time.

The third tone begins on the pitch of a fifth below - as in dia

gram No.1 - and gradually rises to the key note. Or, with a consonant
initial, begins on the key note of the voice — as in diagram No. 2 — drops
to a fifth below , and returns to the key note . It is long in time.
The fourth tone is like the third in pitch and inflection, but
ends abruptly with a strong vanishing stress. It is pronounced
more quickly than the third , but is properly long in time, as is shown

by its changing to the first and second tones in combination , which
are both long tones.

INTRODUCTION .

xiii

The fifth tone, beginning on the fifth of the voice in pitch

with a strong radical stress, descends rapidly and is short in time.
Sometimes, with consonant initials, it seems to take the form indicated
in Diagram No. 2, the stress commencing with the vowel sound .
The sixth tone is the same as the second .

The seventh tone begins on the key -note of the voice, rises to

the pitch of a second with strong emphasis, and descends with
thorough stress to about a fifth below . It is long in time.
The eighth tone has the pitch of a third, is without inflec
tion, and is short in time. It ends very abruptly, though with less
stress than the fourth tone.

INTRODUCTION .

vis

The Rev. D. C. White, M. D., formerly a member of the

Methodist Episcopal Mission, Foochow, now a Professor in Yale
College,

U.S. A. after careful study of the dialect , published the
results of his investigations in the Methodist Quarterly Review. We
quote his graphic delineation of the tones.— " The first, or primary
smooth tone, called sionga sping, is a uniform even sound, enunciated

a little above the ordinary speaking key, but neither elevated nor de

pressed, from the commencement to the close of the word. It is, in
this respect, like the enunciation of a note in music ; it may, therefore,
be called the singing tone, or the musical monotone.

The second , or primary high tone,called siongi siong, is enunci
ated in the ordinary speaking key, and the voice usually talls a note

at the close, as at the end of 2 sentence in unimpassioned discourse.
In connected discourse, however, the second tone is sustained, and
turns upward, like the vanishing stress of unaccented words in com
mon conversation : In attempting to pronounce the letters a-e, we

notice that e is pronounced either a note higher, or lower, than a.
So, also, if we take the pains to listen attentively when a alone is
pronounced , we shall notice that it has its ending, or vanishing move.
ment, turned upward one note ; or, if spoken like ihe close of a sen
tence, where the voice falls in the usual way, we shall perceive that

the vanishing movement of a turns downward one note.

This is

exactly the variety of enunciation, distinguished by the second, or
siongi siong, tone in this dialect.

The third, or primary diminishing tone, called sionga k * ëü ', is
what elocutionists call the rising third, and is heard in English on

the emphatic word in a direct question, as, “ Does it ruin . where
the voice turns upward, through the interval of two notes of the
octave .

The fourth , or primary abrupt tone, called siong ik , turns the
voice upward through the same interval as the third tone; but it
terminates abruptly, as though the voice was suddenly interrupted

in an effort to pronounce a final h . In words which, in other tones,
end in ng,the abrupt close of the fourth tone sounds somewhat like

a suppressed or balt-uttered k, but the clicking sound of the k is
not heard . If a person should attempt to ask the question, “ Can

you open the lock ” and be suddenly stopped before enunciating
the final clicking sound of the k, he would give to the last word the
primary ubrupt tone.

The fifth, or secondary smooth tone, called ha sping, is a quick,
forcible enunciation, commencing about two notes above the ordinary

key, and suddenly dropping down, at theclose, to the key note. It
is what is called by elocutionists the fulling third , and, when em
phatic, the fulling fifth. It is sometimes called the scolding tone.
It is heard in a petulant enunciation of the emphatic words in the
sentence, “ No! I'll do no such thing."
The sixth tone is identical with the second , and no words are

arranged under it ; that is, no secondary high , or rising tone, has yet
heel invented in this dialect.

INTRODUCTION .

The seventh or secondary diminishing tone, called hư' k'ëü', is a

guttural downward circumflex. It is, in English, expressive of pe
culiar emphasis, frequently indicating rebuke, scorn , or contempt, as,
“ Whence, and what art thou , execrable shoppe
Back to thy punishment,
• False fugitive."

“ You wrong me every way; you wrong me, Brutus."
The words very many, if spoken with forcible emphasis, would
also exhibit the tone under consideration.

This is probably the most difficult tone in the language to enun
ciate correctly, under all circumstances.
The eighth , or secondary abrupt tone, called had ik, closes
abruptly, like the fourth tone, but differs from it by being enunci

ated or a uniform pitch, a little above the ordinary key. The eighth
tone is an abrupt termination of the first tone, in the same manner

as the fourth tone is an abrupt termination of the third. ”
THE TONES IN COMBINATION

When words are enunciaiel singly, the tones appear in
their full form and are marked in their elements and distinctive
peculiarities. But in compound terms ornames, and inphrases

whose component words are in regimen, or close construction,
they assume striking peculiarities, which in some cases involve a

radical change. These peculiarities relate to the first or leading
tord of the tern or phrase. The only exception that we have
Doticed is when the following word is a mere suffix or unimpor
tant word , in which case the leading word usually retains its ordinary
character as to tone.

The first tone (leading) is usually spoken with a very strongly
marked accent as in sing sang (teacher ), ki 'chi (a foundation ).
The second tone ( leading) has the peculiar inflection noticed
above in the description of tones. It sometimes imparts to the voice
a slightly sarcastic accent, especially when the following word is in

the 3d or 7th tone, as in ‘siong sëü (reward), 'ka mö (to feign ).
The third and seventh tones (leading) cannot be distinguished

form the first (leading). They have the same strongly marked accent.
This is easily tested in colloquial terms which have no generally accepted

character to represent the leading word. Native teachers, in borrowing
a character for it, often disagree. One, perhaps, will use a first tone,
another a third tone, and another a seventh tone, character.

The fourth tone (leading) , when ending in h, has the quality of
the first tone (leading) ; when ending in k, that of the second tone
(leading ). The following are familiar examples :-tiåh , hwa (to pluck

fla wers ) , kah, tiang (a parlor) , téh, kiing (a small table) spoken as
! kiang (a small knife ); paik , ing ( the eight tones) , chek, ngwok ,
the seventh month), tíiék, liéng' (an iron chain ).

INTRODUCTION .

Ivi

The fifth tone ( leading) is spoken in a low or depressed tone
of the voice without marked emphasis. The inexperienced student

in his effort to speak words of this tone in regimen , according to the
rules laid down for the tones in their full form , misses the sound en

tirely, and enunciates it like the first tone in regimen, saying niéng
pwang' instead ofçniéngpwang (a year and ahalf), « pu sak , instead
of spü sirk, ( a Budhist idol). The distinction is very apparent in the
comparative pronunciation of such phrases as ki chi (a foundation)
and kichi ( chess -men ).

The sixth tone is obsolete, or the same as the second .

The seventh tone (leading) is the same as the third tone (lead
ing), q. v.
The eighth tone (leading) has no marked distinction - as that

prevailing in the fourth tone - between words ending in h and k.

In

the city of Foochow it is enunciated in a depressed tone of voice like
the fifth tone ( leading), while in the suburbs, and probably in the
country, it is often heard with a strongly marked accent like the first
tone (leading). This may be regarded as a kind of country brogue.
In phrases having the second word in the fifth tone, this peculiar
brogue is less evident, which is due to the strong radical stress or em
phasis pertaining to that tone. Examples , -pah , 'ma (a white horse),
sioh, pi (a stone tablet), sidh, sta (to drink tea ), pah, t-ak, (the white

pagoda ), hok , seng, (a pupil), hak, e (agreeable), nik , stau ( the
sun) .
TABLES.

The following Tables exhibit the system of Romanized Orthog.
raphy, as used in writing the words or vocables of this dialect. An
approximate representation of the sounds is all that can be hoped for
in this department. Some students prefer i and u to y and w where
these occur in the system . Good arguments may be adduced for
either set of letters . But it should be observed that such arguments

are partial in their application and do not affect the system as a whole,
when the tones and their combinations, as well as the vowel and con
sonant sounds, are considered . It is hoped that the system adopted
in this work will be readily acquired and prove serviceable to the
student.

Note. Much difficulty is experienced in Romanizing some of the final sounds .
( a) Some would write the poi final pwe; others prefer the form puoi.
(b) kroë,
Some give to the kwo final an additional slight a or ë sound, writing it
kuoa
or

( c ) Some would write the kio final küo; others prefer the form kioa or kioë.

Perhaps none of these forms fully represent the required sounds, which are
accurately learned only by imitating the native mode of pronunciation.
(d ) The vowel sounds of the chiu and sieu finals are often confounded-by

teachers as well as others — especially in the suburbs and country. The same
remark
holds in reference to the pwi and hwi finals, the tendency being to use wi
instead of wi.

Note. The eng initial is placed at the head of this table, as it denotes the absence
of any initial consonant, and therefore gives the simplest form of all the tinals

through each tone. Hence all words spoken without an initial consonant, or begin

INTRODUCTION .

xxi

It appears from Table III, and its note of explanation that
there are 90 final syllables, which (as belonging to the eng initial)
are also independent words or vocables. They may be arranged
alphabetically as follows:
a, á, aë, aëh, aëk , aëng, ah , ah , ai, aih, aik, aing, aiu , aiuh, ak , ang ,
au, auh, auk, aung, e, ë, eh, ëh, ek, ëk, eng, ëng, eu , ëü , euh, ëüh ,
ëūk, ëüng, i, ia , (yă), išh , ( yåh ), išk (yák), iăng, (Yăng), ié, ién ,

vaih, wak, wang, wi, wi, wih, wih, wo, woh, woi, woh, wok, wong.
The tables II and III also furnish the data for ascertaining

the number of vocables produced by the combination of initials with
finals and the modification by tones. The whole number is (15X33X

7 ) 3465. Besides these, there are two words not strictly referable
to the table of initial and final sounds, viz ., the semi-vocal nasal ng ?
(no, not) on p . 595 , and the word ngiau, on p. 610, composed of
the initial ng and a final compounded of i and au, --making the
whole number of vocables 3467. But probably less than half of these
are in actual use .

This paucity of vocables or monosyllabic words

is largely compensated by the very frequent union of two or more
words, virtually forming polysyllables, to express simple ideas.
Thus the number of words is in effect increased to several thousands,

which give to this dialect " a richness and variety of expression but
little inferior to that of many alphabetic languages”.
Chinese phrases as foot notes. The expedient of placing the
Chinese characters at the foot of the page was adopted because, while

the dictionary was going through the press, we found it impracticable
to combine our English and Chinese fonts of type in the same text.
A fixed portion of the lower part of each page was, therefore, set
apart for Chinese, the design being to place there the characters

for the more important phrases occurring on the page. A new font
of English type, which we could combine with the Chinese, arrived

just in time to be used in printing the Introduction.

INTRODUCTION .

xxii

List of Radicals and Index of Characters. These are compris
ed in pages 1015—1104 at the end of the volume.

Characters may

usually be found by the alphabetic order of their sounds , as in
English dictionaries. But when the sound of a character is unknown
to the student , or the native teacher gives it a reading different from
that under which it is classed in this Dictionary, reference must be
The radicals are 214 in number, and the larger
part of these are characters in common use. All other characters
made to the Index .

are composed of some one of these radicals and a certain number of
additional strokes . To find a character in the Index , the student
must first ascertain its radical and then the number of additional

strokes made in writing it. To facilitate the search , it will be useful

to observe the following suggestions , which are quoted with slight
modifications from William's Tonic Dictionary , as being well adapted
to our design in this part of the Introduction . “ The best mode of

impressing the forms of the characters on the memory is an important
question ; but in most cases , the union of the radical and primitive as
the two parts to be remembered , has the advantage of simplicity , and
the sound and meaning can be attached to these by the laws of associa
tion better than to a collection of strokes made apparently without plan .

After learning the radicals , a careful examination of the primitives as
given by Callery will show the principles on which the great mass of

characters in the language are formed , and practice in reading and
writing will then make them familiar . Many of the most common
characters are the most difficult to find in the Index ; they are generally
placed under the simpler radicals , where they should be looked for

first. For instance Y , 2 , À V , are all under \ ; #, , an

are

under

:; 2, #,
# are under JL ; all of which are referred to these

radicals chiefly because they were prominent parts of the characters,
and likely to catch the eye . Such anomalous instances amount to

about two hundred , all of them primitives, while the remainder will
give less trouble in ascertaining the proper radical. About one
half ( 108 ) of the radicals are placed on the right or left of the
primitive - constituting one half of the character and easily recognized .

Others, like = ,

), L , CI,, 口 , 行 ,

embrace the primitive and give no trouble .

門 , and 鬥 ,

About 40 of them are

INTRODUCTION .

placed on the top of the primitive, a few of which enter into combina

tion with it, as in more, in such a manner as to give
some hesitation as to the radical; while others, as oh ,

P5, m, tt, je , NJ, are more

apparent.

M,

For many of the

remainder, where the radical is either in combination , or the char

acter is formed of two or three radicals as *, , or III, practice
will soon give the necessary facility in finding. . . . . . In counting
the number of strokes in a character, the radical is not reckoned .

After becoming familiar with the radicals themselves, and having
a general acquaintance with the primitives, the number of strokes
can be most quickly ascertained by inspection. For instance, the

characters ( rice - porridge ), found under the radical ,
is made up of E , * and E , which severally number
3, 6, and 3 strokes, or 12 in all ; the character
(bubbling water),
placed under the radical * , is composed of dig , Ł , JJ,
,
numbering 11 , 7 , 2, and 4, strokes, or 24 in all . The number of
characters formed of so many strokes as these is very few, and in

most cases a glance at the word is sufficient to see how many make
it". The following brief analysis may also be found useful in the
more difficult task of memorizing the general meanings of characters.
"The groups of characters under most of the radicals naturally refer
to the leading idea; about one-third of them are more arbitrary, a
large part of the characters under them having no reference to their

radical. Those of the latter sort are usually primitives, of which
there are about 1700 in the whole language".

In conclusion , the following practical suggestions are made ,
relating principally to the acquisition of the spoken language.
1. Study thoroughly the Orthography, comprising the rudi
ments of the language with the elements of initial, final, and tone in

single words, as given in the Tables.
2. Practice on the rudiments and tables with the native teacher ,

learning to enunciate as he does.

No extent or thoroughness of in

dependent study can ever compensate for deficiency in such practice .

INTRODUCTION .

xxiv

3. Notice the important changes which occur in the combina
tion of tones, as given on pages xv and xvi.
4. Also observe how the final consonants h , k,

and 9, and

some of the initials, are often half-suppressed or seem wholly to
disappear in the easy , native mode of speaking. Very close at
tention should be given to these idiomatic changes, so soon as
thoroughness is attained in enunciating words singly. This is es
sential to ease and accuracy in public address and common con
versation .

5. It will be found useful to pratice writing out, in the Ro
manized form , simple phrases heard in conversation . This will
serve to fix them in the memory, and to draw the attention to many
important words or particles, which otherwise might not be thorough
ly learned for years.
6. The student should by no means confine himself to his books
and teacher, but should mingle with common people and observe
carefully their modes of speaking. The union of study and observa

tion will help to form a style, alike removed from coarseness and
excessive refinement, while exclusive study with a teacher will tend
to the formation of a book - colloquial style , not fully or readily
understood by the people at large.
